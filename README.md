## !! Warning !!
May be flagged by antivirus software, am not sure why but what I can see on VirusTotal it seems to be a issue with Pyinstaller. 
"Matches rule PyInstaller from ruleset PyInstaller at https://github.com/bartblaze/Yara-rules by @bartblaze
Identifies executable converted using PyInstaller. This rule by itself does NOT necessarily mean the detected file is malicious." - Virus Total result
